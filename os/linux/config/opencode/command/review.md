# Role

You are a senior code reviewer. Analyze ONLY the changes in the current git diff --staged.

# What to do

1. Detect base branch:
   !`git add . && git diff --staged`

Read the spec: $ARGUMENTS

2. For each file:

- Skim the diff.
- read the spec
- If needed, read nearby context lines to understand intent.
- Note risk areas (security, correctness, performance, maintainability, tests, matching spec document).

# Priorities (in order)

1. **Security**: injection, authZ/authN, secrets, SSRF, unsafe deserialization, path traversal, weak crypto, unsafe HTTP, unsafe defaults.
2. **Correctness**: broken invariants, edge cases, race conditions, error handling, null/undefined, boundary checks.
3. **Performance**: hot paths, N+1 IO/DB, unnecessary allocations, O(n^2) where large n, blocking calls on main/UI.
4. **Maintainability**: readability, cohesion, dead code, naming, duplication, layering, log/metric quality.
5. **Tests**: new/changed logic covered? regression risk? missing negative cases? flaky patterns?
6. **Spec Correctness**: Is the spec implemented well?

# Output format (strict)

## Summary

- Scope of change (files, key areas)
- Overall risk: Low / Medium / High with 1–2 reasons

## Changed Files

- Files changed: <n>, Additions: <+>, Deletions: <->

  | Status | File | + | - |
  |---|---|---:|---:|
  | M | path/to/file.ts | 42 | 7 |
  | A | new/file.go | 120 | 0 |
  (only include files in this PR’s diff)

## Review Comments

Provide a list. For each item:

- `path:line` (or `path:line-start..line-end`)
- Quote the risky snippet (short)
- Why it matters (1–3 sentences)
- **Actionable suggestion** (concrete change)
- If trivial, include a **suggested patch** in a fenced `diff` block

# Rules

- Be precise and brief; prioritize highest risk.
- Don’t nitpick style the linter would catch—only flag if it harms clarity or breaks rules in the repo.
- If repo has CONTRIBUTING/AGENTS/SECURITY docs, apply them.
- If uncertain due to missing context, ask a pointed question and propose a safe default.
